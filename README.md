# GhostBox
Creation of a GhostBox from a RDA5807M module

Everything is in the title. I have been recently interested in the ghostbox/spiritbox topic and felt a bit annoyed when saw the price of such device.
Looking at the popular P-SB11 from obscure "ITC research device" on the web, it is obviously overpriced. 
So I had the idea of buying a cheap DIY FM radio kit, assemble it and reprogram the MCU to make it work as a ghostbox.
